This module contains the basic block for the overall register block. 
The Module parameters are:
	NUM_REGS: Can be 16, 32 or 64
	LOG2_NUM_REGS: Can be 4, 5 or 6
	DATA_WIDTH: 32 or 64
	NUM_LANES:8 or 16
The compile time parameters are:
	NUMBER_OF_REGISTERS_IS_32
	NUMBER_OF_REGISTERS_IS_64
	DATA_WIDTH_IS_32	
	DATA_WIDTH_IS_64	
	NUMBER_OF_WARPS_IS_16 (for the register block)
	NUM_LANES_IS_16
Directories:
rtl: contains the verilog implementation
tb:  contains a set of test cases in the format of test_name.sv
     The commands to compile each test is in test_list_bank for the register bank tests
     The commands to compile each test is in test_list_block for the register block tests
     To run the test post compile
     ./simv
     To run all the test cases:
     For the register bank tests
     ./runall_register_bank.sh			
     For the register block tests
     ./runall_register_block.sh
syn: contains the synthesis and timing script
     area report and timing report is generated in the reports directory
     the script must be checked and modified for each run to pass the correct value of 
     compile args and parameter values
     compile time args must be passed to the analyze -d {options}
     parameter values must be passed to the elaborate -parameters {param list}
     To run the script for register bank
     dc_shell -f register_bank.tcl 
     To run the script for register block
     dc_shell -f register_block.tcl 
     The script quits the tool automatically. 
     For the purpose of debug, uncomment the quit command in the last line of the script.
